This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System that uses Logistic Regression to analyze patient health data and predict the presence of heart disease. The model was trained on a structured medical dataset and achieved promising results.

Training Accuracy: ~85.24%

Test Accuracy: ~80.48%

The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to healthcare analytics to assist in early detection and prevention of heart-related issues.
The dataset contains patient records with attributes such as:
1) Age
2) Sex
3) Chest pain type
4) Resting blood pressure
5) Serum cholesterol
6) Fasting blood sugar
7) Resting ECG results
8) Maximum heart rate achieved
9) Exercise induced angina
10) Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise)
11) Slope of peak exercise ST segment
12) Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
13) Thalassemia type

Target Variable
a) 0 - Healthy heart
b) 1 - Diseased heart
